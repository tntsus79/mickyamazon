            <p id="poopy">Hands-Free with Alexa - Make calls, listen to podcasts or Audible books, set reminders, add to your to-do lists, get the news, or control your smart home.
                Open-ear audio with Auto Volume - Echo Frames direct sound to your ears while minimizing what others around you can hear. Plus, with Auto Volume they automatically adjust volume based on the noise level of your environment in real time.
                VIP Filter - Customize which notifications to receive from the contacts and apps on your phone that matter most to you. Top Contact option will enable calling to your top VIP with just a single press and hold of the touchpad to give you a more convenient and seamless way to stay in touch.
                All-day wear - Echo Frames are lightweight and comfortable. They are IPX4 splash-resistant for water and sweat and are available in prescription ready frames, polarized sunglass lenses with UV400 protection or blue light filtering lenses.
                Battery life - Get over 2 hours of talk time, Alexa interactions, and media playback over a 14-hour day. Or, up to 4 hours of nonstop listening on a full charge.
                Does even more - Supports access to Google Assistant and Siri from a compatible device.
                Designed to protect your privacy â€“ Microphones are designed to respond to the voice of the person wearing the frames and turn off with the double press of a button. Amazon is not in the business of selling your personal information to others.</p>
